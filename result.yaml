- The **average model consistently performs better** across most metrics.
- Averaging reduces the influence of poor predictions from either model.

## 📌 Methodology

- Data from the Pune-Nagpur temperature center was used.
- Time series was split into training and testing (last 1000 points for testing).
- Predictions made using each model and then averaged.
- Extensive error metrics were computed and visualized.
- Multiple approaches were explored to understand why the average model performs best.

---

## 🔍 Observations

- **Complementary performance** of models helps the average model outperform.
- High temperature variability increases model errors.
- Ensemble model stabilizes predictions by reducing peaks in errors.
